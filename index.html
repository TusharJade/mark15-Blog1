    <h2>
        First, lets know why websites end with .com
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
        So, why do websites end in .com? Websites end in .com because it is one of the oldest and for sure the most
        recognizable domain extension in the whole world. .com stands for “commercial” and it was the first choice for
        those that started a business website in the early days of the internet. When you buy a domain name to start a
        website you choose a certain string of characters + a tld (top-level domain or domain extension) like .com,
        .net, .org (if the combination is available of course).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        what .com means and how it become so famous?
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
        .com stands for commercial and it was first introduced together with other top-level domain names such as
        .net,.edu,.gov,.mil,.org,.int. Back then it was more like an experiment since the internet was used mainly for
        educational, scientific organizations and government entities. .com was related mostly to companies that had
        some contract with the US government. Gradually it became the number 1 option for all kinds of businesses. The
        release of those top-level domains was back in 1985. Nowdays, anybody can use .com</p>
    <br>

    <h2>
        Who owns .com domain name?
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
        ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is responsible for regulating the .com domain. It is
        an organization that started as a government one but now has independence. ICANN has transferred most of the
        technical operations to a registry (you can think something like a wholesaler for domains) with the name
        Verisign.

        Anyone can buy a .com domain but not from Verisign or ICANN but from companies that we call registrars
        (retailers) like Godaddy or Namecheap
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>
        conclusion:
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
        This are the reasons why .com is always used in the end of most of domains. In short .com ger a first mover
        advantage and its adoption is also very fast thats the reason it is used on large scale now.
